- When writing a commit message, **strictly follow the template you’ve provided** without modification or “improvement”:
  - Before writing anything, **check which files were added, modified, or deleted**.
  - Use your template to decide how to describe the changes — don’t invent your own format or structure.
  - If **multiple files** were changed, use the summary style in your template to explain the changes at a high level.
  - If **only one file** was changed, describe the exact change according to your template.
  - **Include code snippets or terminal commands formatted for Zsh** where your template indicates they are needed.

  Make sure every commit message follows your template exactly and consistently — this helps keep the project’s history clear and uniform for all contributors.
