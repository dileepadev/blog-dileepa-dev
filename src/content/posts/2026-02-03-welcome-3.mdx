## Hello 👋

Welcome to my blog. This is a sample post written in MDX.

Here's a small code block:

```js
console.log('Hello from MDX!')
```

## Introduction

In this extensive post, we will explore the nuances of modern development, specifically focusing on how AI and Cloud computing are converging to create new paradigms in software engineering.

## The Rise of AI

Artificial Intelligence has moved from academic papers to production environments. We are seeing:

### Generative Models
Generative AI is changing how we create content, write code, and even design user interfaces.

### Automated Reasoning
Systems that can think through problems step-by-step are becoming more prevalent.

## Cloud Computing in 2026

The cloud is no longer just "someone else's computer." It's a fabric of intelligent services.

### Serverless Architectures
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) continues to dominate for event-driven workloads.

### Edge Computing
Pushing compute closer to the user to minimize latency.

## Deep Dive: Code Examples

Let's look at how we might integrate a simple AI call in a Node.js environment.

```javascript
async function generateText(prompt) {
  const response = await ai.completion.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    prompt: prompt,
    temperature: 0.7
  });
  return response.choices[0].text;
}
```

## Future Outlook

What does the next decade hold?

### Quantum Computing
While still in its infancy, quantum computing promises to solve problems that are currently intractable.

### Biological Computing
Using biological molecules for computation.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading this first post! Stay tuned for more deep dives.
