## Hello World

Hello and welcome! 👋

I'm **Dileepa Bandara**, an **AI Engineer** on a mission to learn, build, and share. This blog is my corner of the internet where I document the ideas, experiments, and lessons I encounter across **Artificial Intelligence**, **Software Development**, and **Cloud Computing**.

Technology is a vast playground, and I'm curious about all of it. From collecting data and training models to designing scalable systems and writing clean, maintainable code I believe the best way to grow is to **explore broadly** and **share honestly**.

Here's what you can expect from this blog:

✨ **Weekly reflections** on what I'm learning  
🧠 **AI & machine learning insights** - models, tools, and best practices  
💻 **Software development stories** - patterns, languages, tooling, and workflows  
☁️ **Cloud computing explorations** - architectures, services, and real-world use cases  
📚 **Curated resources** - tutorials, book notes, articles, and learning paths  
💡 **Project journeys** - challenges, solutions, and lessons learned

…and much more as I continue exploring the ever-evolving world of technology.

Whether you're an aspiring engineer, a tech enthusiast, or a fellow developer, I hope this blog gives you **ideas, inspiration, and meaningful insights** for your own journey.

Let's learn, build, and grow - one post at a time.

Stay curious. Keep your intelligence sharp!  
**Dileepa Bandara**
