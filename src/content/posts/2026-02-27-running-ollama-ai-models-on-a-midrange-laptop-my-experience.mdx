## Introduction
If you're curious about running AI language models locally, Ollama makes it possible, even on a midrange laptop. Here's my experience installing and testing models on my ASUS VivoBook 15.

## System Details

Before diving into AI, let's look at my hardware and software setup:

* **Laptop:** ASUSTeK VivoBook 15 X542UF
* **CPU:** Intel® Core™ i7-8550U x 8 threads
* **RAM:** 16 GB
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce MX130 (2 GB VRAM) + Intel UHD Graphics 620
* **Disk:** 1.8 TB SSD
* **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, 64-bit, GNOME 46, Linux Kernel 6.17

This is a typical midrange laptop, good for everyday tasks, but limited for large AI models.

## Installing Ollama

Installing Ollama is straightforward on Ubuntu:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer will:

* Create an `ollama` user
* Add you to the appropriate GPU/video groups
* Set up a systemd service
* Detect NVIDIA GPU if present

After installation, verify the version:

```bash
ollama --version
# e.g., ollama version 0.17.4
```

## Running AI Models

### First Attempt: LLaMA 3.2

I tried to run the flagship model:

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

The download worked perfectly, but the process immediately crashed:

```
Error: 500 Internal Server Error: llama runner process has terminated: exit status 2
```

Why?

* The MX130 GPU has **only 2 GB VRAM**, far below the 24 GB+ needed for LLaMA 3.2.
* CPU mode is also impossible for this model on a 16 GB RAM laptop it requires **≥32 GB RAM**.
* Ollama tried to use the GPU automatically, and the model process failed instantly.

### Working Models on My Laptop

Smaller models work perfectly, including:

| Model         | RAM Requirement | Notes                             |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `gemma3:270m` | ~1-2 GB         | Works flawlessly, very responsive |
| `gemma3:1b`   | ~4-6 GB         | Works, slower on CPU              |
| `llama2:7b`   | ~12-14 GB       | Fits, CPU-only, may swap          |
| `llama3:3b`   | ~8-10 GB        | Works, slow on CPU                |

> **Tip:** Always start with the smallest models first to test performance.

Models that **do not run**:

* `llama3.2`
* LLaMA 2 13B+ or 70B
* Any model requiring ≥24 GB GPU memory or ≥32 GB RAM

### Removing Non-Working Models

Once I realized `llama3.2` would not run, I removed it to free up disk space. Ollama provides a simple command:

```bash
ollama rm llama3.2
```

After running this, checking the list of models confirms it's gone:

```bash
ollama list
# Only gemma3:1b and gemma3:270m remain
```

This is a useful step to **keep your system clean** and avoid clutter with large, unusable models.

### Checking Your System Before Running Models

1. **GPU visibility:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

2. **Available RAM:**

```bash
free -h
```

3. **List available Ollama models:**

```bash
ollama list
```

> Only pick models that fit in your RAM or GPU limits.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hardware matters:** Midrange laptops can run small models (hundreds of millions to a few billion parameters) but cannot handle flagship models locally.
2. **GPU vs CPU:** Ollama auto-detects GPU. If your GPU is too small, large models will crash.
3. **RAM is critical:** Large LLaMA models require **≥32 GB RAM** to run on CPU.
4. **Start small:** Models like `gemma3:270m` give you instant results and let you experiment safely.
5. **Remove non-working models:** Use `ollama rm <model-name>` to free disk space.
6. **Cloud is an option:** For LLaMA 3.2 or 70B models, consider Ollama Cloud, Google Colab Pro, AWS EC2 GPU instances or Azure VMs with sufficient resources.

## Conclusion

Running Ollama AI locally is possible, even on a modest laptop. The trick is to **match model size to hardware limits**. With 16 GB RAM and a small GPU, smaller models like `gemma3:270m` or `llama2:7b` are perfect for learning, testing, and experimentation.

Once you upgrade your hardware or move to a cloud instance, you can explore larger models like LLaMA 3.2 and beyond.
