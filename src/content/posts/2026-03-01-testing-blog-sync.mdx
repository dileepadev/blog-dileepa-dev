## Why this post exists

I just implemented a new CI/CD workflow that automatically syncs blog posts from this repository to my centralized API database.

When this post is pushed to the `main` branch, the following should happen:

1. **Build & Deploy:** The Astro site builds and deploys to GitHub Pages.
2. **Sync Script:** A post-deploy job runs `scripts/sync-blogs.mjs`.
3. **API Update:** The script sends this post's metadata to `POST /blogs/sync`.
4. **Database Insert:** The API creates a new record for this post with the next available index.

If you are reading this on the live site, steps 1 is complete. If you see this post in the database (or API response), implementation is fully successful!
