## Checking duplications

Previous sync created duplicates by mismatching existing entries.
We updated the API to match by `slug` OR `link` (for legacy entries).

This post is to confirm:
1. No duplicates created for existing 8 posts (they should get `slug` field added).
2. This new post is created correctly.
3. Indexing logic works (should be max existing index + 1).

If successful, there will be exactly **10 posts** in the database after this sync (8 legacy + 1 first test + 1 this test).
