## Re-testing the sync script

This is a third test post to verify that the `sync-blogs.mjs` script correctly identifies existing posts and only syncs this new one. 

Expected behavior:
- Older posts are grouped, identified, and skipped automatically.
- This new post is synced successfully without errors.
- The `skipped` counter tracks the right amount of old posts.
