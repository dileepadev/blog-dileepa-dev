## Introduction
You might have experienced this frustrating situation. You **contributed to a repository, pushed commits at the correct date and time**, but GitHub **does not show your contributions on the graph**.

This isn't the same as “GitHub showing the wrong date”, it's about **commits not appearing at all** in your contribution activity.

### Why This Happens

GitHub determines whether a commit counts as a contribution based on a few rules:

1. **The commit must be made with the email associated with your GitHub account.**
2. **The commit must be pushed to a repository that is not a fork.**
3. **The commit must be on the default branch (`main` or `master`) or a branch merged into it.**
4. **GitHub tracks the commit date (`AuthorDate`), not when it was pushed.**

Even if your commit satisfies these conditions, it **may still not show** due to subtle issues:

* The author email in Git does not match your GitHub account.
* The commit is on a branch that **appears to be the default** but for some reason GitHub hasn't recognized it yet.
* The commit is very recent, and GitHub hasn't refreshed the contributions graph yet (rare).

### How to Fix Missing Contributions

If your commits are **correct locally** but **not appearing**, the solution is to ensure both the **author information** and **commit dates** are correct.

#### 1. Check Your Git Config

Make sure your commits use the correct GitHub email:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

Your `user.email` must match one of the emails in your GitHub account.

#### 2. Interactive Rebase to Fix Commits

If multiple commits need fixing:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

* Replace `N` with the number of commits to rewrite.
* Change `pick` → `edit` for each commit you want to fix.
* Leave other commits untouched.

#### 3. Amend Each Commit

When Git stops at a commit:

```bash
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2026-02-18 21:25:24 +0530" \
git commit --amend --no-edit --date "2026-02-18 21:25:24 +0530"
git rebase --continue
```

* Repeat for each commit.
* Adjust the timestamp if needed (for contributions to show on the correct day).
* Ensure the author email matches your GitHub account.

#### 4. Verify the Commit Dates

After the rebase finishes:

```bash
git log --pretty=fuller --date=local
```

Check that:

* `AuthorDate` is correct.
* The author email matches your GitHub account.
* The branch is the default or merged into default.

#### 5. Push the Updated Branch

Since history was rewritten, force push is required:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

After this, GitHub should recognize your commits and display them in the contributions graph.

### Key Takeaways

* **Missing contributions aren't always a date issue** email, branch, or repo type can prevent commits from showing.
* Even if your commits are on the **default branch**, GitHub may not show them if author/email or commit metadata is off.
* **Rewriting commit history** with correct author dates and email usually fixes the issue.
* Always **verify locally** before force-pushing rewritten commits.

### Final Thoughts

GitHub's contributions graph can be surprisingly strict, but understanding how it counts commits ensures your work is recognized. By checking:

* Author email
* Branch and merge status
* Commit dates

…and using interactive rebase when needed, you can fix missing contributions and make your GitHub graph accurately reflect your hard work.
